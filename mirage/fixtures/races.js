Democrats might hold out some hope that King will tweet out more incendiary statements like his recent one comparing NFL players' kneeling protest to people using a Nazi salute. But this district is unlikely to see a blue wave, given that it swung decisively in Donald Trump's favor in 2016 after narrowly supporting Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Shirley is a nonprofit leader and the founder of an anti-Trump group, New York’s 2nd District Democrats, who made headlines for petitioning the Federal Election Commission to deem childcare costs a legitimate campaign expense. With $200,000 in the bank, she is better equipped down the stretch than Gregory, a Suffolk County legislator who has made campaign finance reform his key issue and has the backing of former Rep. Steve Israel and the Congressional Black Caucus.",
